Hi! I'm Thanmay Jayakumar, and I am a final year UG student in Electronics & Communication Engineering at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India.

I developed my interest in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) at [IvLabs](https://ivlabs.in), the Robotics & AI Lab of VNIT, where I reviewed state-of-the-art architectures like RNNs, Seq2Seq and Transformers and implemented them.

Apart from NLP, linguistics also captivates me. I have done significant study of various languages and their morphology, such as German, Persian, Malay, Chinese and Indic languages.

I aspire to alleviate language barriers by improving tools for multilingual communication.
