### Spoken Term Detection (Audio Retrieval) [[Project Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R1s4v7eVY_E23BnEazHlMeAqAmnNEr43/view?usp=sharing) [[Presentation]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10bY3bLbavWcnO55Mnepy46Sl3WTqQLdn/view?usp=share_link)

#### Research Intern at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India.
  * Aimed at solving the task of Spoken Term Detection (STD) to retrieve queried speech files in an audio database.
  * Implemented three different approaches to STD for query localization, classification and location suggestion in a database.
  * Analyzed an optimal combination of the above, in order to work towards building a language-agnostic system.

### Statistical Machine Translation [[Presentation]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ws3ViFsy404ads5mE8fe7KTQh-Peost-/view?usp=sharing)

#### Associated with Language Technologies Research Centre, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India. 
  * Aimed at investigating the effects of different evaluation metrics during the tuning phrase of an SMT model.
  * Compared the results of models tuned on BLEU, chrF, TER, WER and PER on a subset of the IndicWAT corpus.

### Neural Models for Natural Language Processing

#### Associated with IvLabs, Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, India.

##### Sentiment Analysis [[GitHub]](https://github.com/IvLabs/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/text_classification)
* Aimed at the automatic determination of polarity in text.
* Compared the results of different architectures such as LSTM, FastText and BERT on the IMDb dataset.

##### Automatic Speech Recognition [[GitHub]](https://github.com/ThanmayJ/automatic-speech-recognition)
* Aimed at developing an end-to-end ASR system.
* Deployed Deep Self-Attention Networks [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.13377.pdf) in Keras using the LJ Speech Dataset.

##### Neural Machine Translation [[GitHub]](https://github.com/IvLabs/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/neural_machine_translation#summary)
* Studied papers presenting novel architectures for NMT.
* Implemented Encoder-Decoder architectures in PyTorch using the Multi30k Dataset for German-English.

##### Name Generation [[GitHub]](https://github.com/IvLabs/Natural-Language-Processing/tree/master/char_rnns#summary)
* Generated dinosaur names by developing a character-level Language Model using PyTorch.
* Compared the results of Vanilla RNN, LSTM and GRU.
